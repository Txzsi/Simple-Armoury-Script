# Simple-Armoury-Script
A simple armoury script that features a clean UI and a vehicle racking system. The script is very easy to configure and everything is pretty much explained throughout the config file. The code is not the absolute best and this was pretty much a paid project that was gonna be released but was abandoned- so here it is, for free!
